## Introduction

This repository primarily contains the code used to convert FLASH simulation to OSIRIS simulation, though it is generally for analysis of simulations related to the Magnetized Collisionless Shocks on Z experiment, led by Professor Derek Schaeffer.

## Installation

To install MagShockZ, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Schaeffer-Lab/MagShockZ.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MagShockZ
    ```

3. Install the [pyVisOS](https://github.com/UCLA-Plasma-Simulation-Group/pyVisOS.git) package for visualization:
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/UCLA-Plasma-Simulation-Group/pyVisOS.git@dev
    ```

Visualization of OSIRIS data utilizes the pyVisOS package, so it is highly recommended to install it.

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md).

## Contributing

Please contact me through GitHub (ID: dschneidinger) if you have any questions about the project, or if you would like to use these tools to convert other FLASH simulation data to OSIRIS data.
